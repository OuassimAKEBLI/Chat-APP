Due to a java project during my master one, I had to develop an application with a GUI, that lists all the persons in the database, beside adding, deleting and updating a person's profile.

- Before starting the software you need to configure the data source server, port, database name, username and password .
- The src/main/resources in package "sql" contains two files one for creating table and the second for creating and adding data .
- You can generate the first data either by doing it manually from the add form or launch the unit test .
- All copyrights for the icons and backgrounds and code going to Ouassim AKEBLI.
